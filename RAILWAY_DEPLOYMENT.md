# Railway Discord Bots Deployment

## üöÇ Deploy Discord Bots to Railway

This guide will help you deploy the Discord bots to Railway alongside your existing Discord setup.

### Prerequisites
- Railway account with existing Discord project
- Discord bot tokens and environment variables
- Access to your Railway project

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Railway

Add these environment variables to your Railway project:

```bash
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bulldog_community_bot_token
PUPPERS_GAME_BOT_TOKEN=your_puppers_game_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=1412282717164408903
DISCORD_GAMES_CHANNEL_ID=1412288663190245478

# API Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. **Option A: Deploy from GitHub**
   - Connect this repository to Railway
   - Set the root directory to the project root
   - Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` configuration

2. **Option B: Deploy via Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Deploy the project
   railway up
   ```

### Step 3: Update Website Configuration

Add the Railway Discord service URL to your Vercel environment variables:

```bash
# In Vercel dashboard or via CLI
RAILWAY_DISCORD_URL=https://your-railway-project.railway.app
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   üöÇ Starting Railway Discord Bots...
   üêï Starting Bulldog Community Bot...
   ‚úÖ Bulldog Community Bot connected successfully
   üéÆ Starting Puppers Game Bot...
   ‚úÖ Puppers Game Bot connected successfully
   üöÇ Railway Discord Bots started successfully!
   ```

2. **Test from Website**
   - Visit your website
   - Trigger a level up or role change
   - Check Discord for notifications

### Features

#### üêï Bulldog Community Bot
- Manages red notification badges for all channels
- Creates server icon notification badges
- Comprehensive notification system across all 34 channels
- Channel-specific badge management

#### üéÆ Puppers Game Bot

- Level up notifications with native badges
- Role change notifications with native badges
- Clean embed messages

#### üöÇ Railway Integration
- Both bots run continuously on Railway
- API endpoints for website communication
- Health checks and monitoring
- Automatic restart on failure

### API Endpoints

The Railway service exposes these endpoints:

- `GET /api/status` - Check bot status
- `POST /api/notification-badges` - Create notification badges
- `POST /api/game-notifications/level-up` - Post level up notification
- `POST /api/game-notifications/role-change` - Post role change notification

### Monitoring

- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **Status Check**: `GET /api/status`
- **Logs**: `railway logs`

### Troubleshooting

1. **Bots not connecting**
   - Check Discord bot tokens
   - Verify bot permissions in Discord
   - Check Railway logs for errors

2. **Website can't reach Railway**
   - Verify `RAILWAY_DISCORD_URL` environment variable
   - Check Railway service is running
   - Test API endpoints directly

3. **Notifications not appearing**
   - Check Discord channel permissions
   - Verify bot has access to channels
   - Check Railway logs for errors

### Benefits of Railway Deployment
